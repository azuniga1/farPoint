						<h4>A short guide to fundraising for founders and officers</h4>
						<p>While the big NPOs in America have political, economical, and marketing
							clout that rivals their “for profit” counterparts, the vast majority of NPOs in the
							country are small and constantly and need to be constantly searching for new
							revenue streams. Competition for dollars means survival or bust.This quest for
							dollars against the big NPOs may seem like a David and Goliath clash, but the
							small NPOs need to remember all is not lost. Size shouldn’t matter as much as
							wit, nimbleness, flexibility, and strategy. Think David and Goliath… the smallish
							David only had a couple of rocks and a sling, while Goliath’s big sword and axe,
							though potent weapons, had to be used up close and personal to be effective….
							We all know how that turned out.</p>
						<p>Like David, the nation’s smaller NPOs have to use their vision and on-the
							ground resources, to gather money in their battle for survival… heck, maybe they
							might even thrive. Should THRIVE really.</p>
						<p>Money talks and walks so let’s look as a near dozen ways to pull in dollars,
							resources and allies.</p>
						<ol class="c">
							<li class="b">Whether it’s one person, or a group of dudes, your non-profit idea has to have
								a clear, concise, vision. Maybe only one in a hundred people share your
								vision. If your idea is compelling, that one person will pitch in; find a thousand
								people and you have a ten donors. That vision has to be as contagious as a
								cold. Well, you get the idea: No Vision = Pipe Dream.</li>
							<li class="b">A good Board of Directors initially packed with the visionary founders’
								instincts is an excellent place to start building the organization, but as the
								NPO progresses, a strong Board of Directors dotted with professional experience
								can help guide the NPO’s long term success. Professionals, meaning lawyers, accountants,
								technicians, managers, love to add a line on their resumes that says,
								“Member. Board of Directors” of such and such NPO. These experts probably won’t be giving you the
								professional services that they would otherwise commercially provide, but
								their advice, hints, and suggestions are worth their weight in gold. Often times
								Directors donate and even more often, get their professional colleagues to donate, Quid Pro Quo is a reality in the professional world. Sometimes these
								Directors will offer advice you don’t like, but “yes sir” on weak and foolish
								ideas is a formula for failure. In the end, Professionals are always a win-win
								asset (unless your NPO name is Goliath )</li>
								<li class="b">Grant writing money is the lifeblood of many NPOs and sometimes one of the
									founders will have to do the heavy lifting in researching and writing the first
									funding grant effort. But having a professional Grant Writer is a great leap
									forward, and is probably free to the NPO. How so, you ask? Every Grantor,
									be it a foundation, university, agency or individual understands that nothing is
									free and good Grant Writers budget creation costs into the project proposal. At
									first the NPO may have an option to hire free lancers to do the job but, in the
									long run, a full time position should be created within the organization. In any
									case the key founder(s) should not take the job permanently… founders
									provide the vision, expertise and day-to-day administration of the NPO that
									keeps it going forward. They have a vested interest in success.</li>
								<li class="b">Social, Professional and Business connections enhance the founders’ ability
									to tap outside financial resources. These connections alert the NPO to
									outsiders with money… be they agencies, companies, institutes or people
									with similar interests and perhaps goals that your NPO can provide. Never
									underestimate the outside “insider” who knows his or her organization has
									needs that they can’t internally solve… and you can. Constantly be on the
									lookout to promote your NPO’s expertise and solution strengths. Keep eyes
									open and minds alert.
								 </li>
								 <li class="b">Cool names and trophies bring in money, I call this whole process the
									“Challenge Cup” syndrome. There is no end to hobbies, interests, sports and
									crafts that people endeavor
									to master every day with a
									competitive edginess that
									drives them to excel. Bikers,
									runners, gardeners,
									hobbyists, etc really love
									their particular unpaid (and
									maybe unrewarded}
									interests. BUT they love
									awards that recognize their
									expertise and sooth the lack
									of monetary compensation.
									Organize a charity “Run for
									the cure of …” and you’ll see runners tap their friends and families for $$$ Per
									Miles just for a chance at a trophy. “Roses for [whatever]” contest will bring out
									that vibrant community’s lust for the limelight, again for simple trophies.
									Almost any hobby, any interest, any competitive activity will provide people
									with a rationale to part with their money for an award that proves how first rate
									they are… but more about egos later on. True story: many years ago an NPO
									I worked with, had a pretty sharp President looking into just the Challenge
									Cup concept we discussed. He had an even sharper office secretary, just out
									of high school, who he tasked her with the “coordinator chairman” label and
									told her to have at it. Within a few years she was running successor events as
									well as other income generation activities. Millions of dollars later she became
									corporate secretary, then Vice President and finally President with even more
									success than her old boss. Never underestimate the ability of a “sharp”
									employee to take a simple task to new heights. Bring on good employees,
									trust your people, give them meaningful tasks, and finally give them your
									vision.</li>
								<li class="b">Speaking of egos, in the last 30 years the “naming rights” gig has risen to new
									levels. Every sports venue has a name attached to the building, stadium,
									field… whatever. King Soopers is the “grocery store of the Broncos," Coke “is
									the drink of the NFL," Pizza Huts is… [you guessed it]. Ordinary people
									(well, at least ordinary rich people) get into the name game to push their ego.
									Every hospital has a
									building name, a plaza
									name, some research
									center named after a family
									or loved one… for a hefty
									naming fee of course. Most
									families have less money
									but the same ego. Why not
									a worthy NPO naming their
									headquarters (or rented
									building) the “XYZ Family
									Research Center” or
									somebody funding an NPO
									internship called the “ABC
									Memorial Fellowship” for a
									position you need filled by a super intelligent young student. Egos have no
									bound when people have money looking for a new home…yours.</li>
								<li class="b">Telemarketing is a dirty word to some people… but it brings in money. Lots of
									it! Telemarketing firms will (for a giant slice of the pie) call every household
									and telephone in your area with a heartwarming story about your NPO. They
									do the work, hire the telemarketers, collect the money and cut you a small
									share of the proceeds for your NPO’s name and image rights. Say the
									telemarketers collects $100,000 and refunds back to the NPO a measly
									$15,000 cut. Seems small, but it is $15,000 just for the use of the NPO’s
									name and storyline. Think about this: almost every retailer would be happy for
									a profit of $15,000 for every $100,000 spent on inventory, rents, marketing,
									employees and other expenses of store operation. Who cares what the
									telemarketer did with his money? The donor gets the tax break, the IRS is
									satisfied, society feels good and the NPO has money to carry out its mission.</li>
								<li class="b">Make your Web Site one of your profit centers. A web page tells your story
									and the services you offer. It often becomes your public face, especially to
									strangers. Make sure you have an easy touch “Donate Now” button. If
									readers don’t donate, OK… maybe later. If you don’t ask, the answer is “NO.”
									A hit means donations go straight to the NPO bottom line</li>
								<li class="b">E-mail is the new postal service. Never talk with anyone without getting an email
									address. Then use it to promote your ideas, events, news, and name.
									Facebook is another avenue to get your message out… and don’t forget to
									ask for a “share” and indicate an address for a direct donation.</li>
								<li class="b">As you go along,think about the idea of having friends, clients and other
									people bequeathing all, or part, of their estate to your NPO. Use the ego
									building naming tool noted above. No one gets to take their estate with them.
									And if you have a worthy NPO their wealth and name lives on in the form of
									site names, special gifts plaques, etc. Be worthy of that consideration.</li>
								<li class="b">Research projects are another source of funding. No matter what, your NPO
									does, it has expertise in something. The NPO’s people might do the actual
									research itself or it might be a cooperating research agency for a university,
									company, other NPO, or government body. Never give up, and always
									promote the idea that your NPO is the “Go To Expert.” Money will follow.</li>
						 </ol>
						 <p>Build a “Field of Dreams” that is full of fans ready to help your NPO reach
							its funding goals and needs. Your vision is the key to success, but be nimble and
							quick.</p>
