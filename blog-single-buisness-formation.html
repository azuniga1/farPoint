						<h4>Q. Are there other why reasons why a business incorporation makes sense?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> Yes, here are a few:</p>
						<ul class="a">
							<li class="b">Many businesses also prefer to do business with formal corporations since it
								offers them a model that “seems” more professional;</li>
							<li class="b">Incorporating or forming an LLC, while not simple, is not the high priced,
								complex, expensive, time consuming proposition that lawyers would have you
								believe (Colorado laws and preplanned agendas make it possible to incorporate
								without an attorney or high priced accounting firms);</li>
							<li class="b">Incorporation, especially a “Sub S Corp,” gives the small business professional
								the protection of a corporation, more flexibility than an LLC, a partnership or
								sole proprietorship, plus it gives incredible potential for tax and employee
								benefits for the owners and their families while increasing the company’s
								status in the business community;</li>
							<li class="b">With the right packages, corporations, or LLCs , can work easier with
								Independent Contractors and provide wage, benefit and retirement packages
								(to both owners and employees) that simply not available to the average self
								employed person or partnership.</li>
							<li class="b">It is also easier to pass on your business to family since a “corporation” is a
								legal entity with a life of its own, whereas a sole proprietor business and
								partnership normally dissolves with the death of the individual owner or
								partner. Existing contracts, accounts payable and leases remain with the
								corporation and do not have to be renewed with the passing or incapacity of
								the owner;</li>
							<li class="b">This ability to pass on the LLC company is more limited and it is definitely more
								difficult to colllect bills and enforce contracts for heirs. Not impossible but
								harder</li>
							<li class="b">The same goes when the original Sub S owners wants to sell. It can be done in
								part (sell some shares) or whole (sell all the shares) or even sell the entire
								business. New owners and shareholders can also be brought on board by selling
								shares (from the shareholder) or the corporation can raise money by expanding
								the shareholder base and using the proceeds for corporate purposes.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Q. I’m a sole proprietor and it’s just me. Do I really need to incorporate or form an LLC?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> That depends on your exposure to accidents, injuries, contracts, employees, Independent
							Contractors, government agencies and anyone or any group that might want to sue, litigate or
							file a grievance against you. If you ever have employees or use Independent Contractors, it is
							likely they can put you at risk by accidents, carelessness, illegal or fraudulent acts in your
							business name, misrepresentation and the list goes on and on. Never underestimate the
							number of people and organizations and even government agencies that want a piece of your
							wealth. Incorporation at least limits their access to your assets.</p>
						<h4>Q. What does a corporate structure look like?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> There are a number corporation forms, but the BIG 3 are:</p>
						<uL class="a">
							<li class="d">A “C” corporation is the legal structure you normally envision in the big
								companies, such as AT&T, with stockholders, boards of directors, etc;</li>
							<li class="d">An “S” Corp is designed for smaller business operations and has many of the
								advantages of a sole proprietor but with the legal benefits of a corporation. It
								also has a flexible, and favorable, tax structure for the owners;</li>
							<li class="d">An LLC is much like a partnership (and to an extent a sole proprietor) with
								corporate protection. Taxes work very much like a partnership or self employed
								business person. Dissolution of the LLC is similar to a regular partnership.
								Partners pay personal and self employment taxes. The good part is that
								partners have personal liability protection similar to formal corporations.</li>
						</uL>
						<h4>Q. How hard is it to incorporate or form an LLC for my business?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> The <u>short answer</u> is “not very.” Colorado has a simplified process that allows companies
							and individuals to incorporate their business using standard forms and formats. The <u>long
							answer</u> is that the “devil is in the details,” and those details can be hellish. While the
							formal process makes it very easy to set up the corporate status there are other, very
							important matters, such as business registration, IRS recognition, obtaining business and
							knows the ropes as well as the twists and turns of the process.</p>
						<h4>Q. So I need a lawyer and accountant, is that right?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> Not necessarily. Colorado laws and procedures make it easy for an individual, or a
							consultant, working with a business owner, to create a corporation. Simple corporations, such
							as a “C” or “S” Corp or even an “LLC”, can be formed, without a lawyer and/or accountant if
							all the new ownership is “on board” and cooperative with each other. Many individuals form
							corporations on their own, or with special assistance, and then they run the matter by their
							attorney or designated accountants for a relatively quick, low cost, review and approval
							process. Once your corporation is up and running, you can do the bookkeeping yourself or hire
							a staff accountant/bookkeeper or hire a service to keep track of your financial transactions
							and taxes. In an “apples to apples” comparison, the book work and tax issues are not much
							more complicated for a corporation than a sole proprietorship or partnership operation. <i>Far
							Point Colorado</i> offers accounting and tax preparation services.</p>
						<h4>Q. When do I definitely need a lawyer or accountant?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> Businesses that are very complex in nature, have some or all foreign owners or ownership,
							have varied ownership classes, are involved in owning other corporations, deal in regulated
							business matters, have real estate holdings that are offered for sale or rent, have large
							classes of stockholders, plan on issuing revenue bonds, do business in multiple states or work
							exclusively with state/federal regulatory agencies should see an attorney (and probably a
							CPA). Complexity may require the professional expertise of a lawyer and maybe an
							accountant. But Colorado does not require an attorney driven incorporation process and most
							entrepreneurs forming corporations can do it on their own or with limited assistance from
							companies such as <i>Far Point Colorado business solutions.</i></p>
						<h4>Q. If I do the incorporation process myself, or have someone assist me, should I see a
							lawyer or an accountant review the paperwork and legal issues?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> It never hurts to have others review your business plans and incorporation papers. By
							having a legal or accounting professional just review your paperwork you get peace of mind,
							and perhaps they will find an error or something else that needs to be added to your final
							work. <i>Far Point Colorado</i> meets and works with a variety of professional advisors at the
							request of our clients to make sure that you have the best of all worlds. If an attorney,
							accountant, or professional advisor suggests changes or adjustments to our plan for you, we
							will make those changes at no additional cost to you.</p>
						<h4>Q. What’s the best corporate status for me [and my partner]? Or for that matter, my
							family?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> <i>Far Point Colordo</i> works with owners, entrepreneurs, prospective stock and shareholders,
							family members, etc to review business goals to determine the best business corporate model
							for any specific situation. Everyone, every group, every circumstance is different, <i>Far Point
							Colorado </i>professionals make sure that clients have the best professional advise possible and
							its guaranteed service comes at an economical price. Clients can call anytime, at no charge,
							for advice with issues that may arise.</p>
						<h4>Q. Why not use one of those on-line computer incorporations?</h4>
						<p><b>A.</b> Mechanically they work fine, but what this on-line process lacks is the experience and
							feel that an individual consultant can give the business owner. For instance, few people
							realize that the initial meeting of the Board of Directors really sets forth the company’s
							Constitution by defining positions, titles, job descriptions, lines of authority, succession
							plans, etc and in troubled times, if they occur, the legal process goes back to that original
							meeting to establish “intent and fact.” This Constitution, as I call it, can be changed at
							subsequent Board Meetings but these factors must, at some point, be addressed. Nothing
							takes the place of foresight and preparedness. On-line mechanics can not beat “boots on the
							ground.” <u class="dotted"><b><i>Far Point Colorado</i> works with you personally!!</b></u></p>
