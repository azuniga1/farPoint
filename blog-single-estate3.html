						<h3>So what is an Estate plan?</h3>
							<p>Simply speaking an Estate Pan is a portfolio of legal documents which declares
							the Grantor’s wishes and instructs the state, medical establishment, courts, heirs,
							and loved ones what to do if the Grantor is incapacitated or dies.
							</p>
							<p>Unfortunately no one document, or “one-size fits-all” plan exists. The whole
							Estate Plan process is simple and complex at the same time.
							</p>
							<P>American law is based on English Common Law and as such an individual has
							the right to declare what will happen to him or her if they are deceased, or even
							if they are alive but unable to make decisions. This includes the right to pass onto
							heirs, of their choosing, the fruits of the Grantor’s labor.
							</P>
						<h3>A good Estate Plans will:</h3>
							<uL class="a">
								<li class="b">Nominate someone, called a Personal Representative or Executor, to manage
									the Decedent’s Will after he or she passes on;</li>
								<li class="b">Direct who will protect and manage the Grantor’s assets while the Grantor is
									alive but unable to do so;</li>
								<li class="b">Nominate someone to speak for the Grantor if he or she is incapacitated for
									any physical, medical or mental reason;</li>
								<li class="b">Pre-determined medical and health treatment if dthe Grantor cannot
									communicate his or her wishes;</li>
								<li class="b">Redirect the Grantor’s financial affairs to so as to minimize tax liabilities during
									the Grantor’s life or after death;</li>
								<li class="b">Direct, within limits, those who will inherit Estate;</li>
								<li class="b">Provide for the care and protections of loved ones who cannot care for
									themselves because of medical, mental, physical, or age related incapacities;</li>
								<li class="b">Provide skip provisions that pass assets on into the future to give another
									generation part of Estate assets</li>
								<li class="b">And, for many American families, formulate a plan for the care, protection,
									growth and provisioning of children who may be left orphaned in the event that
									both parents die and this can be done by pre-appointment of Representatives
									as Conservators and Guardians of such children.</li>
							</uL>
						<h3>How To Create an Estate Plan?</h3>
							<p>For many people an Estate Plans starts with fining an attorney who will schedule
								multiple meetings to gather information about a variety of situations and issues
								that are unique to the future Grantor. Good Attorneys can also offer legal
								counseling and may bring in accountants and other experts to draft a plan. Such
								planning, especially in complex situations, will require analysis from a variety of
								angles and goals. That attorney may also draft an individualized plan for approval
								or, at the very least, offer written options for the client to ponder and implement
								going forward.
							</p>
							<p>But an Attorney is not the only option.</p>
							<p>Adults can also work with Estate Planners who have expertise and experience in
								all facets of Estate Planning. These planners may, or may not, draft legal
								documents and for the Grantors to review with an Estate Attorney.
							</p>
							<p>Any ordinary Attorney is not a good alternative. The Lawyer that can keep you
								out of jail, or reduce a DUI conviction, or sue your neighbor, may know nothing
								of estate planning, insurance, medical care issues, or Trusts.
							</p>
							<p>And for either an Attorney or Estate Planner always be sure of the costs and
								obligations ahead of time.
							</p>
							<p>If you do your own Estate Planning be aware that many pitfalls may lay in your
								path… finding out about some legal issue too late is… too late. Retakes are few
								and far between after you are deceased.
							</p>
						<h3>Estate Planning Documents</h3>
							<p>There is no one Estate Planning Document and every plan is different requiring
								different documents. So let’s start:
							</p>
							<ol class="c">
								<li class="d"><b>First off, a Will,</b> or at least the idea, simply originates from Ole English laws
									that alleged an individual had a right to give or “will” his property to whoever
									he desired. We say “he” because in the beginning “she” had no such rights.
									Women’s rights came later, much later. Essentially a Will allows a Grantor to
									provide directions and instructions regarding the Grantor’s assets and
									conveying to a Personal Representative, or Executor, the power to administer
									and disperse the Grantors assets after he or she dies. It sets up an Estate
									with legal authority to Probate the Estate but only after the Grantor has died.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Revocable Living Trust (RLT)</b> is really a substitute Will that allows a Grantor,
									or Grantors, the ability to manage their assets while the Grantors are alive and
									then extend that management after the Grantor dies. This RLT is a legal entity
									managed by a Trustee, normally the Grantor during the individual’s lifetime. The
									RLT assets are gifted to the Trust by a Grantor, also called the “Settlor,” who
									appoints a Trustee to manage the Trust. If this Settlor/Trustee is unable, for any
									reason, to manage the Trust business and assets, a Successor Trustee can take
									over. The same thing happens when the Grantor/Settlor/Trustee dies… the
									named Successor Trustee becomes the Trustee, which now normally becomes
									an Irrevocable Trust with a slightly different legal status but again required to
									adhere to the wishes, or will, of the Grantor/Settlor that are contained in the
									Trust Document. This succession plan and details about the “Will” of the Grantor/
									Settlor must be carefully planned and documented BEFORE the RLT goes into
									effect.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Irrevocable Trusts (IR)</b> are sometimes set up by Grantors. These IR’s are
									legal entities with legal, financial, and tax obligations and they have a separate
									Trustee who is independent of the Grantors in management affairs but still rigidly
									obligated to adhere to the terms of the IR Trust Agreement. Individuals, banks,
									attorneys can serve as Trustees and are normally compensated for their
									services. Grantors often set up IR’s to protect vulnerable heirs who need
									additional protection or guidance apart from what a Will would provide. Often
									times individual will provide additional funding by gifts from their individual Wills.
									By the way, an IR is an excellent means of passing off assets to future, or skip,
									generations. Perhaps ironically the Grantor can act as Trustee until he or she
									dies and then a successor Trustee takes over.<br><br>
								<i>But death is not the only problem Estate Planning can tackle!</i></li>
								<li class="d"><b>Financial Powers of Attorney (POA)</b> are another key planning tool.
									Sometimes called a General Durable Power of Attorney, this forward looking
									document addresses the needs and authority to control the Grantor’s finances in
									troubled times. With a POA, a personal representative, call Agent, can control
									the Grantor’s personal financial matters if the Grantor is unable to do so
									because of physical, medical, mental, or physical situation. It becomes effective
									when preset perimeters are triggered and ceases when the Grantor is competent
									to regain control. This is a powerful tool and we suggest a doctor(s) determine
									medical or mental competency. The Agent has no control over personal financial
									management after the Grantor dies. That power is then transferred to the Estate
									Personal Representative or the Trust Trustee.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Business Power of Attorney (BPOA)</b> is similar to the personal POA but
									refers to the independent business operations of an individual. This is especially
									important for sole proprietors, majority and officer class shareholders of S
									Corporations and single member LLC’s. Every business needs an operating
									agreement and a succession plan. The reason lies in the nature of business
									contracts and ownership. If an individual leading any of these business entities
									can not function the entire business operation may be jeopardy and come
									crashing down before its leader can retake charge. Often times the mate of a
									business owner does not have the expertise to continue the business is an
									emergency situation. A carefully chosen friend, associate, or lieutenant may save
									the business to see another day. This Business POA does not necessarily die
									with the death of the business owner but the Agent is likely (and should be legally
									bound) to provide set benefits to the Estate. Careful, careful care should be used
									in drawing up this legal document This BPOA can be written in the company bilaws,
									legal agreements, or separate legal contracts.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Medical Power of Attorney</b> nominates an Agent to make health care
									decisions in the event an individual cannot do so or communicate those wishes.
									Normally the individual’s mate steps into this role, but maybe h/she is not the
									best person for the task. This Agent acts on the individual’s behalf while that
									person is living but unable to communicate, regarding minor or critical decisions.
									One advantage of the MPOA is that it can be written and become effective
									immediately or at a later time or even over time. It can be revoked when the
									individual is able to make decisions. A similar <b>Mental Power of Attorney</b> is also
									advisable covering mental and phycological problems that may not be as
									apparent as a physical injury or sickness. This is especially important for
									individuals with a history of mental illness or drug usage. Either of these POA’s
									needs the protection of a doctor’s diagnosis and signature. As an aside, it is also
									a protection for the decision maker who may have to make very difficult
									decisions.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Declaration of Disposition</b> of Last Remains/Burial gives a living person’s
									instructions about the disposition of his or her Last Remains after death. Many
									people think the EPR makes this decision, and it is often the case, but it is not a
									legal right of the EPR. This Disposition gives directions, instruction and
									information about the remains and the events surrounding the remains. It
									answers such questions as burial or creation or such matters as a funeral or
									memorial service. And if the deceased has a burial plan, such as a place prepaid
									burial plot or even a cremation plan. Such information can lift a great burden of
									the family and perhaps give the EPR a heads up on possible financial burdens of
									the Estate. This document is also a key to unlocking contracts regarding prepaid
									plans.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Other Benefits for Heirs</b> may also be available. For instance
									a Payable-on-Death (POD) beneficiary designation on IRA’s, Retirement plans,
									investments documents, and Bank accounts as well as many financial plans
									haveTransfer-on-Death (TOD) provisions going automatically to the co-signer.
									Joint tenancy financial arrangement also nearly always transfer to the co-signer.
									Life insurance always by-passes the estate and the Probate process. Husband
									and wife joint ownership of property also passes without incident (but with
									possible attendant debt).</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Tax Planning</b> is a must for nearly every Estate since taxes can possibly be
									deferred, eliminated, or decreased with proper advanced planning. This can
									include income taxes, property taxes, and a myriad of Estate taxes. Remember
									the Estate is responsible for both assets and debts.</li>
								<li class="d"><b>Professional Cooperation</b> is another must. Your tax preparer, accountant,
									life insurance agent, business manager and attorney all play important parts in
									your Estate management but they seldom meet or communicate with each other.
									You might compare it to a football team never getting into a huddle…and
									expecting not to be crushed. Probably the Estate Planner or attorney ought to be
									the point-man in this endeavor if the individual lacks expertise or time to get the
									plan “up and running.” It is important for the individual to understand the role
									each plays in the Estate Planning process. Take a look at these professionals:
									<uL class="a">
										<li><i>The Tax Preparer</i> is likely to have followed the client’s money matters,
											investments and deductions for a number of years;</li>
										<li><i>The Life Insurance</i> agent has ready access to a variety of financial tools
											and scenarios and the creation of an “instant estate;</li>
										<li><i>The family Accountant</i> may or may not play a role in many Estate
											Planning panels but if the individual has a personal or business
											accountant this guy will have important input.</li>
										<li><i>The Financial Advisor,</i> like the Life Insurance agency, has ready access
											to investment, estate planning and money matter software packages that
											can be coordinated with other financial partners. Even if the individual
											only has company retirement plans, a Financial Advisor is worth some
											money to improve financial performance prior to death;</li>
										<li><i>The Attorney</i> is another key part of the Estate Plan. Making everything
											legal will save a lot of time and money down the road.</li>
										<li><i>The Estate Planner,</i> and most people don’t have one, makes it his or
											her business to look out for problems and come up with solutions. This
											person;s experience and training may be as important as the Attorney
											in making the Estate Plan bullet proof;</li>
										<li><i>The Life Partner</i> (be they wife, husband, significant other, whatever) is
											not just a silent partner or perhaps even a friend but rather a key
											component in any Estate Plan. Now if this person is not a professional
											in the same vain as those above… he or she likely has insights of this
											person that are as important as any professional’s educated guess.</li>
									</uL>

						<h2>Once again...too late is really, really too late!</h2>
						<h3>And in conclusion</h3>
						<p>Every Estate Plan is unique… like fingerprints, no two family situations are alike:
							Available and potential asset, goals, health issues, family dynamics, retirement
							plans, IRA’s, Social Security benefits, family debt, age, even IQ, makes every
							Plan a one-of-a-kind affair.</p>
						<p>A good plan will makeup for a lot of unfavorable factors and still magnifies
							advantages on the ground.</p>
