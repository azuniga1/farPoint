						<h3>What is a Colorado Living Trust?</h3>
						<p> In essence, a Colorado Living Trust is simply a document that consists of one’s plan for the
							management and disbursement of his or her assets that springs into action upon his/her
							incapacity or upon his/her passing.</p>
						<p>Similar to a Colorado Will, Colorado Trusts are “revocable,” meaning that they can be modified
							or eliminated at any time while one is competent to do so. A Colorado Living Trust is
							established by a written agreement or declaration which appoints a “trustee” to administer the
							property, and which gives detailed instructions on how the property is to be managed and
							eventually distributed.</p>
						<blockquote class="quote-post">
							<p>
								Lid est laborum dolo rumes fugats untras. Etharums ser quidem rerum facilis dolores nemis omnis fugats vitaes
								nemo minima rerums unsers sadips amets.. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h3>Who Can establish a Colorado Living Trust?</h3>
						<p>Any competent adult eighteen years and older can establish a Colorado Living Trust.</p>

						<h3>When Does a Colorado Living Trust Take Effect?</h3>
						<p>A Colorado Trust takes effect immediately upon its execution. However, until it is funded, there
							are no assets to control or distribute.</p>
						<h3>How is a Colorado Revocable Living Trust Properly Executed?</h3>
						<P>Unlike Colorado Wills, a Colorado Living Trust does not require any witnesses. Due to the
							importance of the document, a Colorado Trust should be executed in the presence of a notary
							public.</P>
						<h3>Can a Colorado Living Trust Be Changed or Revoked?</h3>
						<p>A Colorado Living Trust can be changed or revoked at any time as long as the Settlor of the
							Colorado Trust is competent at the time of the change or revocation. The Trust document often
							time mandates that the Living Trust be changed, migrated or turned into Irrevocable Trust upon
							the Death of the Grantor with a designated new Trustee.</p>
						<h3>Who Can Be a Trustee?</h3>
						<p>In Colorado, any competent adult age eighteen or older can be the trustee, including the person
							setting up the trust. A Colorado bank or trust company is also an option to designate as a
							trustee. The initial Trustee can even be the original Grantors, allowing that person to retain
							control of the Trust for his or her lifetime.
							You can appoint more than one trustee, can delegate different duties to
							each trustee, and can retain the power to remove the trustee and appoint
							a new one. Appointing an alternate trustee is essential if you are the first
							trustee and the trust will carry on after you die or become incapacitated.</p>
						<h3>Differences Between a Colorado Living Trust and a Colorado Will</h3>
						<p>Both a Colorado Living Trust and a Colorado Will are documents that can
							be changed or revoked at any time and act as a vehicle to transfer one’s
							assets upon his/her passing. First, we will examine the differences how the documents affects
							one while he/she is alive and upon his/her passing.</p>
							<p>During one’s lifetime, a Colorado Will offers very little benefit except to know that one has his/
								her affairs in order. The reason is Colorado Wills do not come into effect until one passes away.
								A Colorado Living Trust, however, comes into effect once it is executed and funded. It can
								circumvent the need for a potentially expensive and public court procedure called a
								Conservatorship. Instead of a court overseeing the management and disbursement of your
								assets and who will be in control of your financial affairs, your Colorado Trust handles these
								private matters with no court intervention.</p>
								<P>The differences between a Colorado Living Trust and a Colorado Will upon one’s passing are
									also great. First, since a living trust document is not a public document, it offers privacy of your
									of personal assets and affairs. Second, if the Colorado Revocable Living Trust was funded
									properly, the settlement can avoid the need for a Colorado probate court proceeding, can be
									more efficient, less time consuming and the legal fees can be substantially reduced. Third, if
									one has real property in more than their resident state, a probate court proceeding can also be
									avoided in every state the real property is located. Fourth, it allows you as the settler of the
									Colorado Trust a greater degree of control on how and when disbursements are made. Fifth, it
									can prevent a certain amount of funds from ever being subject to an Estate Tax or a Generation
									Skipping Transfer Tax. Finally, and arguably most importantly, it can offer your heirs the best
									form of asset protection available, if drafted properly</P>
						<h3>Can a Settlor Transfer Property Into and Out of a Living Trust While He or She Is Alive</h3>
						<p>While the Settlor is alive, he or she can transfer their property into and out of his or her Colorado
							Revocable Living Trust as needed during his/her lifetime. Once the property is titled in the
							Revocable Living Trust, they can still make gifts as he/she pleases as well as distributions to
							themselves for whatever they desire.</p>
						<h3>Can One Transfer Their Home, with a Mortgage, Into Their Revocable Living Trust</h3>
						<p>Simply put, the answer is yes. There is a federal law which precludes lenders from exercising
							any due on sale clause on one’s principal residence to their Colorado Living Trust. It is
							advisable to get your lender’s consent before you fund your home into your Living Trust if you
							have a mortgage lien against it</p>
