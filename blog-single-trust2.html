						<h3>What is a Colorado Living Trust?</h3>
						<p> In essence, a Colorado Living Trust is simply a document that consists of one’s plan for the
							management and disbursement of his or her assets that springs into action upon his/her
							incapacity or upon his/her passing.</p>
						<p>Similar to a Colorado Will, Colorado Trusts are “revocable,” meaning that they can be modified
							or eliminated at any time while one is competent to do so. A Colorado Living Trust is
							established by a written agreement or declaration which appoints a “trustee” to administer the
							property, and which gives detailed instructions on how the property is to be managed and
							eventually distributed.</p>
						<blockquote class="quote-post">
							<p>
								"Living trusts are an option to consider as part of your estate plan. 
								Many people prefer to use a trust because it allows complete control over assets."
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h3>Who Can establish a Colorado Living Trust?</h3>
						<p>Any competent adult eighteen years and older can establish a Colorado Living Trust.</p>

						<h3>When Does a Colorado Living Trust Take Effect?</h3>
						<p>A Colorado Trust takes effect immediately upon its execution. However, until it is funded, there
							are no assets to control or distribute.</p>
						<h3>How is a Colorado Revocable Living Trust Properly Executed?</h3>
						<P>Unlike Colorado Wills, a Colorado Living Trust does not require any witnesses. Due to the
							importance of the document, a Colorado Trust should be executed in the presence of a notary
							public.</P>
						<h3>Can a Colorado Living Trust Be Changed or Revoked?</h3>
						<p>A Colorado Living Trust can be changed or revoked at any time as long as the Settlor of the
							Colorado Trust is competent at the time of the change or revocation. The Trust document often
							time mandates that the Living Trust be changed, migrated or turned into Irrevocable Trust upon
							the Death of the Grantor with a designated new Trustee.</p>
						<h3>Who Can Be a Trustee?</h3>
						<p>In Colorado, any competent adult age eighteen or older can be the trustee, including the person
							setting up the trust. A Colorado bank or trust company is also an option to designate as a
							trustee. The initial Trustee can even be the original Grantors, allowing that person to retain
							control of the Trust for his or her lifetime.
							You can appoint more than one trustee, can delegate different duties to
							each trustee, and can retain the power to remove the trustee and appoint
							a new one. Appointing an alternate trustee is essential if you are the first
							trustee and the trust will carry on after you die or become incapacitated.</p>
						<h3>Differences Between a Colorado Living Trust and a Colorado Will</h3>
						<p>Both a Colorado Living Trust and a Colorado Will are documents that can
							be changed or revoked at any time and act as a vehicle to transfer one’s
							assets upon his/her passing. First, we will examine the differences how the documents affects
							one while he/she is alive and upon his/her passing.</p>
							<p>During one’s lifetime, a Colorado Will offers very little benefit except to know that one has his/
								her affairs in order. The reason is Colorado Wills do not come into effect until one passes away.
								A Colorado Living Trust, however, comes into effect once it is executed and funded. It can
								circumvent the need for a potentially expensive and public court procedure called a
								Conservatorship. Instead of a court overseeing the management and disbursement of your
								assets and who will be in control of your financial affairs, your Colorado Trust handles these
								private matters with no court intervention.</p>
								<P>The differences between a Colorado Living Trust and a Colorado Will upon one’s passing are
									also great. First, since a living trust document is not a public document, it offers privacy of your
									of personal assets and affairs. Second, if the Colorado Revocable Living Trust was funded
									properly, the settlement can avoid the need for a Colorado probate court proceeding, can be
									more efficient, less time consuming and the legal fees can be substantially reduced. Third, if
									one has real property in more than their resident state, a probate court proceeding can also be
									avoided in every state the real property is located. Fourth, it allows you as the settler of the
									Colorado Trust a greater degree of control on how and when disbursements are made. Fifth, it
									can prevent a certain amount of funds from ever being subject to an Estate Tax or a Generation
									Skipping Transfer Tax. Finally, and arguably most importantly, it can offer your heirs the best
									form of asset protection available, if drafted properly</P>
						<h3>Can a Settlor Transfer Property Into and Out of a Living Trust While He or She Is Alive</h3>
						<p>While the Settlor is alive, he or she can transfer their property into and out of his or her Colorado
							Revocable Living Trust as needed during his/her lifetime. Once the property is titled in the
							Revocable Living Trust, they can still make gifts as he/she pleases as well as distributions to
							themselves for whatever they desire.</p>
						<h3>Can the Grantors Transfer Their Home, with a Mortgage, Into Their Revocable Living Trust?</h3>
						<p>Simply put, the answer is yes. There is a federal law which precludes lenders from exercising
							any due on sale clause on one’s principal residence to their Colorado Living Trust. It is
							advisable to get your lender’s consent before you fund your home into your Living Trust if you
							have a mortgage lien against it</p>
						<h3>Will My Colorado Living Trust Protect Me From My Creditors?</h3>
						<p>A Colorado Living Trust does not provide any asset protection from
							one’s creditors that you have accumulated. But assets within the Trust,
							that are owned by the Trust, have legal protections from outside
							creditors. Accordingly, one cannot create a Colorado Living Trust to
							prevent a creditor from having access to his or her assets. If drafted
							properly, sub-trusts created upon the Settlor’s passing for his or her
							beneficiaries offer tremendous asset protection. Unencumbered property
							transferred into Irrevocable Trust can, however, be protected from you
							personal creditors since they have been transferred to a “third party” that
							was probably appointed and directed by you.</p>
							<h3>Does a Copy of One’s Colorado Living Trust Need to be Recorded with the Courts?</h3>
							<p>No. A Colorado Living Trust is a private document that does not need to be recorded with any
								court. Once a Colorado Trust becomes irrevocable and is worth more than $500.00, Colorado
								law requires a Trust Registration Statement to be filed in the District Court in the county the
								Trust is administered.</p>
							<h3>What is Probate?</h3>
							<p>Simply put, probate is the legal process for transferring your property when you die. More
								specifically, it is a court procedure that involves validation of one’s Last Will and Testament,
								appointment of a personal representative, collection of assets, notification and payment to
								creditors, and transfer of property to the beneficiaries under one’s will.</p>
							<h3>Why Should One Want to Avoid Probate?</h3>
							<p>While Colorado probate can be relatively simple, it is still a public process that allows others to
								know of some of your most private and personal matters. A Colorado probate proceeding must
								last at least six months but is more likely to take twelve to eighteen months to finalize. The legal
								fees for a Colorado probate procedure can also run upwards of five percent of the value of one’s
								estate.</p>
							<P>A Colorado Living Trust avoids the probate process because you collect your assets and
								transfer them to your Trust before you die. As long as you do not have any real estate or assets
								totaling $50,000 in your name, you can avoid the time and legal expense associated with
								probate.</P>
							<h3>If One Has a Colorado Living Trust, Is a Last Will and Testament Necessary?</h3>
							<p>If one’s Colorado Living Trust is properly funded, a Last Will and Testament to dispose of one’s
								assets is not necessary. However, if minor children or special needs children are involved, the
								Last Will and Testament designates who will be those individual’s Guardian. As part of your
								Colorado estate planning package, a Pour-over Last Will and Testament is included to transfer
								any property that may not have been funded in the Trust as well as to handle your children’s
								affairs and to designate who your Personal Representative will be if it is necessary to open
								probate.</p>
							<p>What Types of Property Should Not Be Transferred Into a Colorado Living Trust
								An IRA, 401(k) plan or Keogh plan, wherever invested, must remain in the owner’s name and
								Social Security number. Between husband and wife, the Surviving Spouse is usually named the
								primary beneficiary and the Trust may be named the contingent beneficiary. Please realize that
								any change of a beneficiary designation of a retirement plan could have important income tax
								consequences; therefore, you should consult with your tax advisor prior to making any change.</p>
							<h3>Establishing a Colorado Trust</h3>
							<p>You should take two steps. First, sign the
								Colorado Trust Agreement you wish to
								establish. Then, legally transfer all assets to
								be titled into the Living Trust to the trustee.
								Deeds, stock transfers, new bank accounts,
								and other legal documents may be necessary.
								Assets not formally transferred to the trustee
								will probably not be considered part of the trust
								and might still be subject to probate.</p>
							<h3>Income Taxes</h3>
							<p>By itself, a Colorado Living Trust does not avoid or reduce any of Settlor’s income taxes. During
								the Settlor’s life, a Colorado Living Trust does not require its own income tax return to be filed.
								Instead, all income is reported on the Settlor’s individual income tax return.</p>
								<h3>Estate Taxes</h3>
								</p>A Colorado Living Trust can include standard provisions for saving estate taxes and generation
								skipping transfer (GST) taxes. Each Settlor of a Colorado Living Trust can exclude up to a
								certain amount (In 2011, the amount is $5 million) that will not be subject to either an estate or a
								GST tax. If drafted properly, a Colorado Trust can help ensure the first $5 million in assets will
								never be subject to an estate or GST tax in any of your heir’s estates.</p>
							<h3>How Long Does a Colorado Living Trust Last?</h3>
							<p>A Colorado Living Trust lasts only as long as the Settlor. Again, some Living Trusts transfer all
								assets into an Irrevocable Trust but this measure must be outlined in the original Living Trust
								documents. At the death of the Settlor, a Colorado Living Trust’s terms can provide for the
								outright disbursement of assets, for the assets to remain in the Irrevocable Trust, or a hybrid of
								the two. For assets that remain in Irrevocable Trust, Colorado law allows for trusts to continue
								for the benefit of the Settlor’s heirs for over 1,000 years. Trusts that provide for multiple
								generations are known as dynasty trusts and can offer a tremendous amount a tax and asset
								protection benefits.</p>
