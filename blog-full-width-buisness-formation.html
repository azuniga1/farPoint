			<p>Some of you have the vision to start your own business., other worked hard to build and maintain
				their business…And America is a great place to do business. Our laws and general business
				atmosphere are conducive to success. We can find and serve clients and customers with a variety of
				ideas, services, and products. Our laws and government provide us with guidelines that establish
				ground rules we can live with everyday.</p>
			<p>It certainly is a good time to be in business.</p>
			<p>But the very factors that make success possible also harbor potential disaster for sole
				proprietors and entrepreneurs who put their future in jeopardy every minute of every day. None of
				us starts the day thinking we might have a heart attack, mess up a deal, cause or become a part of
				an accident. We trust our employees, partners, and independent contractors to do their jobs
				honestly, safely and well. Most of the time they do just that.</p>
			<p>We hope our customers will recognize our skills, efforts and hard work and understand when
				things go wrong. However, sometimes they don’t.</p>
			<p>Things sometime go wrong…LIFE HAPPENS: accidents, mistakes, carelessness, illegal acts,
				miscalculations and illness are common. Then too, businesses fail to pay us… or sue us… or file
				negative reports on us…Government and regulators change laws and rules and sometimes decide to
				enforce old ones…Employees or independent contractors acting in our name, and under our contract,
				do dumb things that create disaster…Perhaps the IRS or state or local auditors come looking at our
				books and don’t like what they see…STUFF HAPPENS.</p>
			<p>For the sole proprietor or the independent contractor, an investor or the entrepreneur, the
				negative financial fallout can extend to their bank accounts, houses, cars, savings programs,
				retirement income (including social security payment)…And adverse judgments, liens, finds,
				penalties, credit reports, garnishments, etc can follow them (you?) personally for years and years.</p>
			<p>Fortunately there is a way to protect you, or at least insulate you, from many of the
				business pitfalls that stare you in the eye every single day. That protection is the incorporation of
				your business. Please review the following pages on this web site as you make your decision.</p>	
				<P>Sincerely,</P>
